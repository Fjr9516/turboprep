# âš¡ Turboprep
MRI preprocessing / segmentation in < 30s.

## Usage

```bash
Usage: ./turboprep <image_path> <output_folder> <template_path> [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -t, --threads <threads>               Threads (default: number of cores)
  -s, --shrink-factor                   Bias field correction shrink factor (default: 3), see N4BiasFieldCorrection
  -m, --modality <modality>             Modality {t2,other,md,t1,pd,flair} (default is t1)
  -r, --registration-type <type>        Registration type {t,r,a} (default is 'a' (affine), see antsRegistrationSyNQuick.sh)
  --keep                                Keep intermediate files
```

## Installation

`turboprep` script requires the following softwares to be installed:

* [FreeSurfer](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/DownloadAndInstall) >= v7.4
* [ANTs](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs)
* [intensity-normalization](https://github.com/jcreinhold/intensity-normalization)

A Docker container will be included in the future. 

## Pipeline description

| Step n. | Description                        | Algorithm                                                    | Package                   |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| 1       | Intensity inhomogeneity correction | N4 [1]                                                       | `ANTs`                    |
| 2       | Affine registration to template    | Symmetric Diffeomorphic Image Registration (just affine registration) [2] | `ANTs`                    |
| 3       | Segmentation of brain tissues      | SynthSeg [3] (Love it!)                                      | `FreeSurfer`              |
| 4       | Brain mask extraction              | Thresholding the segmentation                                | `FreeSurfer`              |
| 5       | Intensity normalization            | WhiteStripe [4]                                              | `intensity-normalization` |

## Registration alternatives

Two alternatives powered by deep learning are:

* EasyReg [6] - implemented in FreeSurfer as `mri_easyreg`
* SynthMorph [7] - implemented in FreeSurfer as `mri_synthmorph`

Both algorithms are great, but the overhead of loading the model make their running time slower compared to ANTs when performing affine image registration.
