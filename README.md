## Pipeline description

| Step n. | Description                        | Algorithm                                                    | Package                   |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| 1       | Intensity inhomogeneity correction | N4 [1]                                                       | `ANTs`                    |
| 2       | Affine registration to template    | Symmetric Diffeomorphic Image Registration (just affine registration) [2] | `ANTs`                    |
| 3       | Segmentation of brain tissues      | SynthSeg [3] (Love it!)                                      | `FreeSurfer`              |
| 4       | Brain mask extraction              | Thresholding the segmentation                                | `FreeSurfer`              |
| 5       | Intensity normalization            | WhiteStripe [4]                                              | `intensity-normalization` |

## Registration alternatives

Two alternatives powered by deep learning are:

* EasyReg [6] - implemented in FreeSurfer as `mri_easyreg`
* SynthMorph [7] - implemented in FreeSurfer as `mri_synthmorph`

Both algorithms are great, but the overhead of loading the model make their running time slower compared to ANTs when performing affine image registration.
